# About the Eclass Project
Eclass is an online learning management system designed to facilitate the organization and delivery of educational content. Its primary purpose is to provide a platform where instructors can upload course materials, assignments, and resources, while students can access these materials, submit assignments, participate in discussions, and track their academic progress. Students use Eclass to stay updated with their coursework, communicate with instructors and peers, and efficiently manage their learning activities.

In the files that have been published, you can see the code we have created for the project's requirements, such as a simple Log in / Sign up form and the actions for View, Update, Insert, Delete. You cannot see the database as we did not keep it, but when the project was running, the database was updated accordingly with the user's actions. For this project, we did not use any framework but simple HTML and PHP, as we did not have the flexibility within the course to use those tools, so we kept it simpler.
Additionally, the index page is ready for display if you want to see the template. For the project, the template of the page was a ready-made free template that matched our preferences, so we incorporated it into our page without having to design anything from scratch.
